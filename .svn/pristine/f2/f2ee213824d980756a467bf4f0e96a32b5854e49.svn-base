Code contains both the Python code for PolyHarmonics and the input files for a test.
	--Analysis is the output from running the code on the Python 3 version. It contains 
the text files, the plots and the contour plot from the input Felipe has given me.
	--Grade 0 is a series of input files given to me by Filipe in order to run the analysis. 
Choose the directory above grade 0 in order to properly run.
	--PolyHarmonics-June2nd.py is the code

new_code is the code I am writing personally. The code is complete aside from the creation of the 
Scattering_Data.txt file.
This folder also includes the standard_test_cases folder which is used for testing. Within this folder
there is an input 1 folder which is used for the (currently only) system test as well as 
a Unit Test Output folder which is where the expected output for the unit tests are contained.

PolyHarmonics_MG, PolyHarmonics_MIS,PolyHarmonics_SRS PolyHarmonics_User_Manual and PolyHarmonics_V&V are the module guide, 
module interface specification, the SRS the user manual and the V&V plan respectively. Each are a work in progress and these 
folders contain the .tex files, PDFs and the files needed to compile the .tex files.

The presentations folder contains the presentations on Pweave and PyUnit that I gave in the Thursday morning meetings.
They inlude the PDFs presented as well as any accompanying files as needed.
