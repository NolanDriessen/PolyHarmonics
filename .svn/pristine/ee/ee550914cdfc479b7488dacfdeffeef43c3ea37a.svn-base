new_code is the code I am writing personally. As of right now it is mostly empty.
It contains an uniterated version of the Input Finding Module, Input Data Module and
main completed as far as is necessary for the other two modules.

PolyHarmonics_MG, PolyHarmonics_MIS,PolyHarmonics_SRS PolyHarmonics_User_Manual and PolyHarmonics_V&V are the module guide, 
module interface specification, the SRS the user manual and the V&V plan respectively. Each are a work in progress and these 
folders contain the .tex files, PDFs and the files needed to compile the .tex files.
