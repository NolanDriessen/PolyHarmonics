System as is comparision:

text file comparison:
assert(filecmp.cmp(new_file,old_file,False))  Returns true if the files have exactly the same contents

	-This will check if the input is being found properly from the second column of
Original_Data.txt and Filtered_Data.txt
	-It will check that the filtering is done properly through 
the third column of Filtered_Data.txt
	-And it will check if the DFT is done correctly through the third column of
Original_Data.txt and Filtered_Data.txt
This effectively covers everything aside from the plots. If the DFT, filtering, file finding or any part of the analysis is wrong it will be reflected within these files.



The same thing can be done for the plots, assert(filecmp.cmp(new_plot,old_plot,False))


This covers the input finding, filtering, transforming and plotting which is every large component of the system.



Unit Testing:

Input Finding Module:
	-Create a specific directory to use as input
	-assert that it finds the proper number of files
	-assert each piece of data it pulls out of each file is what it should be

**Next three modules are handled by outside libraries. Do I need to test these?**

Signal Transforming Module: 
	-Compare calculated values to predefined correct values from the standard input


Plotting Module: Same as above, done by Matplotlib
	-Prepare a directory with acceptable output plots for the standard input.
	-size of files? Binary formats difficult to compare. 
	-Filecmp.cmp() with expected plots

Filtering Module:
	-Compare calculated values to predefined correct values from the standard input

Control Module:
	-Unsure of this one, could test the boundaries for the input conditions
ex) Input something with exactly MIN_AMP, something with more something with less.
Other than that it just directs which module comes after each.

Output Module:
	-filecmp.cmp with each of the three files. Correct files will come from standard input

Filtered Data Module/Plot Data Module/Transformed Signal Data Module/Input Data Module:
	-Each data structure will have the specific elements of its structure compared 
with the expected output from the standard input.
